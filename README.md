# Algorithm Package

This package contains various algorithms and functions to perform different calculations and operations. Below is a brief description of each function:

## Addition
- Function: `Addition()`
- Description: This function calculates the addition of two numbers (n and m) and prints the result.

## EvenOrOdd
- Function: `EvenOrOdd()`
- Description: This function takes an integer input from the user and determines whether it is even or odd. It prints the result accordingly.

## Addition1to100
- Function: `Addition1to100()`
- Description: This function calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive) and prints the result.

## Addition1to100odd
- Function: `Addition1to100odd()`
- Description: This function calculates the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive) and prints the result.

## Addition1to100even
- Function: `Addition1to100even()`
- Description: This function calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive) and prints the result.

## SmallNumber
- Function: `SmallNumber()`
- Description: This function finds the smallest number from a given array of integers and prints the result.

## FindAverages
- Function: `FindAverages()`
- Description: This function calculates the average of a given array of numbers and prints the result.

## Notes
- Function: `Notes()`
- Description: This function calculates the total grade based on the midterm and final scores provided by the user.

## Bodymassindex
- Function: `Bodymassindex()`
- Description: This function calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on the user's mass and height inputs. It also provides a BMI classification based on the calculated index.

## Question9
- Function: `Question9()`
- Description: This function takes a list of integer elements as input from the user and sorts them in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm. The sorted list is then printed.

## Question10
- Function: `Question10()`
- Description: This function takes a list of integer elements as input from the user and counts the occurrences of each number in the list. It then prints the number and its count.

Feel free to explore and use these functions for your algorithms and calculations.
